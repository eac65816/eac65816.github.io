<H2 style="font-family:Georgia;color:Gold;">With the first pick of the 2003 NBA draft, the Cleveland Cavaliers selected Lebron James from St.Vincent-St. Mary High School in Akron, Ohio. Standing at 6 ft. 8 in. tall, James was a high school superstar and had heavy media around him at a young age. Thus a basketball legend was born as the NBA was taken over by a man they called "King James".  </H2>

<P> Since joining the NBA in 2003, Lebron James has been a dominant player who will go down as one of the greatest professional basketball players of all time. His massive size paired with his unmatched athleticism allows him to drive hard to the basket and finish at the rim with ease. James has accumulated various accolades over the first 15 years of his career including but not limited to 3x NBA chapion, 4x NBA MVP, 3x NBA finals MVP, 13x NBA All-Star, Rookie of the Year, and 2x olympic gold medalist. In addition to his long resume, James holds many NBA records such as 1st place all-time in assists for a forward, 1st place all-time for points and free throws scored in the playoffs, and the only player in NBA history to average a triple double in the NBA Finals.

<P> "King James" is arguably the best professional basketball of all time, and some people even say that he is better than Michael Jordan was. Both Jordan and James have incredible resumes, and both play with a hate-to-lose attitude that helped them achieve greatness. What I beleive The King possesses over MJ is the ability to continue to win with little to no help on his team. James has already passed Jordan on several lists including all-time scoring, and all-time playoff scoring, but he isn't done yet. What is truly remarkable about Lebron James is his physical fitness at his current age of 33. In fact, last year doctors told James that he had the body of an 18 year old, and as you can tell from watching him play, those doctors were right. This means that the sky is the limit as to how many seasons James can play, which in turn could cause him to break the rest of Jordan's records.
